Movie Recommendation System

Problem Statement
With the rapid growth of streaming platforms, users face an overwhelming number of movie choices, leading to decision fatigue. Traditional recommendation systems often suggest generic or popular movies that do not reflect individual preferences. This project aims to deliver intelligent, personalized recommendations by analyzing the content of movies rather than relying on user ratings.

Features
This system is built using unsupervised learning, specifically content-based filtering. It leverages TF-IDF vectorization to process textual metadata (like genres, keywords, cast, and director) and uses cosine similarity to identify movies that are similar in content. The system can suggest the top 30 most relevant movies based on any given title.

Technologies Used
The project is implemented in Python (3.6+), using a Jupyter Notebook. It makes use of key libraries including pandas for data handling, nltk for text preprocessing, scikit-learn for vectorization and similarity computation, and difflib for fuzzy matching of movie titles.

Project Structure
The repository includes a Jupyter notebook (MovieRecommendation.ipynb) containing all the preprocessing and recommendation logic, a pickled model file (movie_recommendation_model.sav) storing the vectorized data, and a project report (Movie_recommendation_system.pdf) that outlines the system design and evaluation.

Future Improvements
Future versions of this project could incorporate collaborative filtering for better personalization, build a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit or Flask, and integrate user reviews or ratings for richer content analysis. Multilingual support and deep learning approaches can also be considered for scalability and accuracy.
